### Where are the chrome bookmarks

Whatever your reason for needing the location of the bookmarks files, before you modify them or delete them, you must exit Google Chrome. Otherwise, Chrome may detect a change to the files and automatically restore them. Whether you have a Windows, Mac or Linux operating system, you can find your Google Chrome bookmark files just by following a few simple steps. Here is how to get started.

Locating your Bookmark Files in Windows
Google Chrome stores the bookmark and bookmark backup file in a long path into the Windows file system. The location of the file is in your user directory in the path "AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default." If you want to modify or delete the bookmarks file for some reason, you should exit Google Chrome first. Then you can modify or delete both the "Bookmarks" and "Bookmarks.bak" files. These are found easily using the Windows Explorer on Windows 8 or the Explorer on Windows 7.
